Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency.It enforces memory safety—meaning that all references point to valid memory—without a garbage collector.To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent data races, its "borrow checker" tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation.
